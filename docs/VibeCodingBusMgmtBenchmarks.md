**Vibe Coding BusMgmtBenchmarks with**   
**Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro**

**Setting Up With Gemini Canvas Editor**

Make sure you are signed up for the [Gemini Pro plan for students](https://gemini.google/students/?hl=en) so you can use Gemini 2.5 Pro until Spring 26\. 

Then go to Gemini Chat website to begin your vibe coding 

[https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)

Share the following BusMgmtBenchmarks GitHub repo with Gemini:

[https://github.com/calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks](https://github.com/calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks)

Ask the LLM to put the file called company\_to\_company.html (which is in the github repo above) file in a canvas window for you to edit.

**BusMgmt Database Documentation for the Vibe Coding LLM**

Now we will give Gemini some documentation to help it load the data from the BusMgmt dolt database. You need to give this to the LLM everytime you vibe code any webapps so it understands how to pull the data from the database in your web app.

You can give it the link below or if it cannot accept a link, you can download the file and upload it into the chat window. It should show up over in the “Files in this chat” filing cabinet on the right side after you load it up.

**Additional Dolt Database Documentation** 

This documentation applies to dolt in general so is probably not needed. But you can use it if you think the LLM cannot understand the Dolt api from your specific examples. Or if you are asking it to do something that is not in the documentation above.

**Sharing Your Vibe Coded Webapps**

You can share both the link to the webapp you make, and also the prompts and conversations you have to create your apps.

Both of these examples were created in the same conversation with Gemini:
