# Vibe Coding BusMgmtBenchmarks with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro**

## Setting Up With Gemini Canvas Editor**

Make sure you are signed up for the [Gemini Pro Plan for Students](https://gemini.google/students/?hl=en) so you can use Gemini 2.5 Pro until Spring 26\. 

Then go to Gemini Chat website to begin your vibe coding: 

[https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)

Share the following BusMgmtBenchmarks GitHub repo with Gemini:

[https://github.com/calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks](https://github.com/calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks)

This is the GitHub repo with the main files for our project. In particular the html pages in this repo are examples of webapps you can build with the dolt database. 

Ask the LLM to put the file called "company\_to\_company.html" (which is in the github repo above) file in a canvas window for you to edit.

## BusMgmt Database Documentation for the Vibe Coding LLM

Now we will give Gemini some documentation to help it load the data from the BusMgmt dolt database. You need to give this to the LLM everytime you vibe code any webapps so it understands how to pull the data from the database in your web app.

You should download the file and upload it into the chat window since the LLM doesnt always do a good job just with the link. It does better if you actually upload it as a file or paste it in. It will show up over in the “Files In This Chat” filing cabinet on the right side after you load it up.

## Additional Dolt Database Documentation (Not needed Usually)

This documentation applies to dolt in general so is probably not needed. But you can use it if you think the LLM cannot understand the Dolt api from your specific examples. Or if you are asking it to do something that is not in the documentation above.

## Sharing Your Vibe Coded Webapps

You can share both the link to the webapp you make, and also the prompts and conversations you have to create your apps.

Both of these examples were created in the same conversation with Gemini:

## Sharing your Chat Conversation and Prompts 

Here is an example of a chat conversion where we created a few webapps. You can create or edit more than one web page app per chat conversation.


### Chat Link (Go to the sidebar to share)

### Web Apps Created (Share with the Share button)

- [https://g.co/gemini/share/094bbfe673be](https://g.co/gemini/share/094bbfe673be)

I think when you share it shares a particular version of your app. So that if you make further changes you may have to share the "latest" version.
