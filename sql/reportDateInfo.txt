# Report Date Analysis for Dolt Database Financial Records

## Executive Summary
Analysis of report dates across all companies in the financial database reveals several patterns and inconsistencies. Most companies follow consistent fiscal year-end patterns, but there are notable deviations, particularly for 2024 data that appears to use filing dates rather than fiscal year-end dates.

## Key Findings

### 1. Consistent Fiscal Year-End Patterns
Most companies maintain consistent fiscal year-end dates with only minor day-of-week adjustments:

**Calendar Year-End Companies (December 31st):**

- CVS: Consistent 12/31 through 2023, then jumps to 2025-02-12 for 2024
- Louis Vuitton: Consistent 12/31 pattern
- Sherwin-Williams: Consistent 12/31 through 2023, then 2025-02-20 for 2024
- Wayfair: Consistent 12/31 across all years

**Late January/Early February Pattern (Retail Calendar):**
- Most retail companies follow this pattern with consistent dates:
  - February 2nd -> February 1st -> January 30th -> January 29th -> January 28th -> February 3rd -> varies for 2024
  - Companies: Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Best Buy, BJ's, Build-A-Bear, Burlington, Dick's Sporting Goods, Dillard's, Five Below, Foot Locker, Gap, Kohl's, Macy's, Nordstrom, RH, Ross, Signet Jewelers, TJ Maxx, Target, Ulta Beauty

- ASOS: August 31st fiscal year-end

### 2. Major Inconsistencies Identified

**A. 2024 Filing Date vs Fiscal Year-End Issues**
Several companies show dramatic deviations in 2024 that appear to be filing dates rather than fiscal year-end dates:

- **CVS**: 2023: 2023-12-31 → 2024: 2025-02-12 (likely filing date)

### 4. Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Standardize 2024 Data**: Review and correct 2024 report dates to use fiscal year-end dates rather than SEC filing dates
2. **Data Validation**: Implement checks to ensure report dates follow expected fiscal calendar patterns
3. **Fill Missing Data**: Investigate and add missing year data for Ahold Delhaize, H&M, and Louis Vuitton

**Process Improvements:**
1. **Fiscal Year-End Reference**: Maintain a reference table of each company's fiscal year-end pattern
2. **Data Entry Validation**: Add validation rules to flag dates that deviate significantly from established patterns
3. **Source Documentation**: Clearly document whether dates represent fiscal year-end or filing dates

### 5. Impact Assessment

**Data Quality Impact:**
- Approximately 40+ companies show inconsistent 2024 reporting dates
- This affects trend analysis and year-over-year comparisons
- May impact automated reporting and benchmarking calculations

**Business Intelligence Impact:**
- Fiscal period comparisons may be misaligned
- Seasonal trend analysis could be skewed
- Regulatory reporting accuracy concerns

## Conclusion

The database contains robust historical data with consistent patterns through 2023, but 2024 data appears to have been populated using SEC filing dates rather than fiscal year-end dates for many companies. This creates a significant inconsistency that should be addressed to maintain data quality and analytical accuracy.

The most critical issue is the systematic shift to filing dates in 2024, which breaks the established pattern of using fiscal year-end dates. This suggests a process change in data collection that should be standardized.
